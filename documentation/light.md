To connect the Light to Frequency Converter - TSL235R, a light sensor used to determine day and night, follow these simple steps:

Identify the pins on your sensor:

* VCC (3.3V)
* GND
* OUT

Connect the identified pins to your RPI4:

* Connect the OUT pin from your sensor to GPIO 18 on the RPI4 (located at pin 12 on the board). You can also choose another available GPIO pin on your board if needed.
* Connect the GND pin from your sensor to the GND pin on the RPI4 (located at pin 6 on the board).
* Finally, connect the VCC pin from your sensor to the 3.3V VCC pin on the RPI4 (located at pin 1 on the board).


Once you have completed the connections, you can run your code to test the functionality of the light sensor.

By following these steps, you will be able to successfully connect the Light to Frequency Converter - TSL235R to your Raspberry Pi 4 and utilize it to identify day and night based on light levels.
