To connect the Waveshare Laser Range Sensor (ToF) - UART / CAN Bus, a proximity sensor used to detect obstacles ahead of the robot, follow these steps:

The sensor has four cables:

* VCC (5V, red cable)
* GND (black cable)
* RX (blue cable)
* TX (yellow cable)

2.Raspberry Pi Serial Port Setting:

* By default, the Raspberry Pi's serial port is configured for terminal debugging. To use the serial port for communication with the sensor, you need to modify the Raspberry Pi's settings.

* Open the terminal and execute the following command to enter the Raspberry Pi configuration:
sudo raspi-config
* Choose "Interfacing Options" -> "Serial" -> "No" -> "Yes" to disable the serial debugging function.
* Save the changes and exit the configuration menu.
* Reboot the Raspberry Pi by executing the following command:
sudo reboot
1. Connect the identified cables to the RPI4:

* Connect the TX cable from the sensor to the RX GPIO pin on the RPI4 (pin 10 on the board).
* Connect the RX cable from the sensor to the TX GPIO pin on the RPI4 (pin 8 on the board).
* Connect the GND cable from the sensor to the GND pin on the RPI4 (pin 6 on the board).
* Finally, connect the VCC cable from the sensor to the 5V VCC pin on the RPI4 (pin 2 or 4 on the board).
Once you have completed the connections, you can run your code to test the functionality of the proximity sensor.

By following these steps, you will be able to successfully connect the Waveshare Laser Range Sensor (ToF) - UART / CAN Bus to your Raspberry Pi 4 and utilize it to detect obstacles on the road ahead of the robot.
