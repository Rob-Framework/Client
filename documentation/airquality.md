To connect the Gravity Air Quality Sensor - ENS160 for detecting the quality of the air, follow these steps:

Gather the necessary cables and components:

* Gravity Air Quality Sensor - ENS160
* Raspberry Pi (RPI4) board
* Four cables: red (Vdd 3.3v), black (GND), green (SDA), and blue (SCL)

Establish the connections between the sensor and the Raspberry Pi as follows:

* Connect the red (Vdd 3.3v) cable to the 3.3v pin on your Raspberry Pi (pin 1).
* Connect the black (GND) cable to the GND pin on your Raspberry Pi (e.g., pin 6, 9, or 25).
* Connect the green (SDA) cable to the SDA pin on your Raspberry Pi (GPIO 2 or pin 3).
* Connect the blue (SCL) cable to the SCL pin on your Raspberry Pi (GPIO 3 or pin 5).

Enable the I2C interface on your Raspberry Pi if it's not already enabled:

* Open the terminal.
* Run the following command: sudo raspi-config
* Use the UP/DOWN arrow keys to select "Interfacing Options" and press Enter.
* Select "P5 I2C" and press Enter to confirm "Yes".
* Restart the Raspberry Pi.

Once the connections are made and the I2C interface is enabled, you can proceed to run your code and test the sensor to detect the quality of the air.

By following these steps, you will be able to easily connect the Gravity Air Quality Sensor - ENS160 to your Raspberry Pi and utilize it for air quality detection.
