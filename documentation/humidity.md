To connect the Temperature and Humidity Sensor - DHT11 for measuring the temperature and humidity in the environment where your robot operates, follow these steps:

Identify the pins on your sensor:

* Vcc 3.3v (left pin on the front of the sensor)
* OUT (next to the VCC pin)
* NC (Not Connected; we won't be using this pin)
* GND

As this sensor doesn't come with cables, you will need to solder suitable cables to ensure a secure connection.

Once you have connected the cables to the sensor, proceed with the following connections:

* Connect the OUT cable from your sensor to a GPIO pin on the RPI4. You can choose any GPIO pin for this connection, but for this example, we will use GPIO 17.
* Connect the GND cable from the sensor to the GND pin on your Raspberry Pi board (pin 39, 34, or 20).
* Connect the VCC cable from the sensor to the 5V VCC pin on your Raspberry Pi board (pins 2 or 4).

After completing the connections, you can run your code and test the sensor to measure temperature and humidity.

By following these steps, you will be able to successfully connect the Temperature and Humidity Sensor - DHT11 to your Raspberry Pi 4 and utilize it to identify the temperature and humidity in the environment where your robot operates.
