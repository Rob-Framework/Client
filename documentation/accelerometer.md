To connect the Gravity Triple Axis Accelerometer I2C - LIS2DW12 sensor to measure the speed of your robot, follow these steps for better understanding:

Gather the necessary cables and components:

* Gravity Triple Axis Accelerometer I2C - LIS2DW12 sensor
* Raspberry Pi (RPI4) main control board
* Four cables: red (Vdd 3.3v), black (GND), blue (SCL), and green (SDA)

Establish the connections between the sensor and the Raspberry Pi as follows:

* Vdd 3.3v (red cable) connects to the 3.3v pin of your board (pin 1).
* GND (black cable) connects to the GND pin of your board (e.g., pin 6, 9, or 25).
* SCL (blue cable) connects to the SCL pin of your board (GPIO 3 or pin 5).
* SDA (green cable) connects to the SDA pin of your board (GPIO 2 or pin 3).

Ensure that the I2C interface of the Raspberry Pi is enabled. If it's already enabled, you can skip this step.

* Open the Terminal on your Raspberry Pi.
* Type the following command and press Enter: sudo raspi-config
* Use the up and down arrow keys to select "5 Interfacing Options" and press Enter.
* Select "P5 I2C" and press Enter to confirm "YES".
* Restart the Raspberry Pi main control board.

Once the connections are made and the I2C interface is enabled, you can proceed to run your code and test the sensor to measure the speed of your robot.

By following these steps, you will be able to successfully connect the Gravity Triple Axis Accelerometer I2C - LIS2DW12 sensor to your Raspberry Pi and utilize it for speed measurement.
